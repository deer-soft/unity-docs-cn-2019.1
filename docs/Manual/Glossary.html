In an animated humanoid character, the Root Transform is a projection on the Y plane of the Body Transform and is computed at run time. At every frame, a change in the Root Transform is computed, and then this is applied to the GameObject to make it move. <a href="RootMotion.html">More info</a></p>

<div class="Glossary" title="Package Manager">
<a name="PackManLighting"></a>

<h2>Package Manager terms</h2>

<h4>Built-in package<em>:
</em>Built-in* packages allow users to toggle Unity features on or off through the Package Manager. Enabling or disabling a package reduces the run-time build size. For example, most Projects don’t use the legacy Particle System. By removing the abstracted package of this feature, the related code and resources are not part of the final built product. Typically, these packages contain only the package manifest and are bundled with Unity (rather than available on the package registry).</h4>

<h4>Bundled package<em>:
Unity stores </em>bundled* packages in the <a href="upm-cache.html">global cache</a> when you install Unity. You can install these packages in your Project even if you are completely offline (not currently connected to the internet or a local network).</h4>

<h4>Default package<em>:
Unity automatically pre-installs a select number of </em>default* packages (for example, the Analytics Library, Unity Timeline, etc.) when you create a new Project. This differs from a <strong>bundled package</strong> because you don’t need to install it and it differs from a <strong>built-in package</strong> because it extends Unity’s features rather than being able to enable or disable them.</h4>

<h4>Embedded package<em>:
An </em>embedded* package is a package that you store under the <code>Packages</code> directory at the root of a Unity Project. This differs from most packages which you download from the package server. <a href="upm-concepts.html#Embedded">More info</a>
</h4>

<h4>Git package*:</h4>

<p>The Package Manager retrieves Git packages from a Git repository directly rather than from a package registry. Git packages use a Git URL reference instead of a version, and there’s no guarantee about the package quality, stability, validity, or even whether the version stated in its <code>package.json</code> file respects Semantic Versioning rules with regards to officially published releases of this package. <a href="upm-concepts.html#Git">More info</a></p>

<h4>Immutable*:</h4>

<p>You cannot change the contents of an immutable (read-only) package. This is the opposite of <strong>mutable</strong>. Most packages are immutable, including packages downloaded from the package registry or by Git URL.</p>

<h4>Local package<em>:
A </em>local* package already exists on the file system, usually outside the Project folder. To install the package, notify the Package Manager of its location through the <strong>Packages</strong> window. <a href="upm-ui-local.html">More info</a>
</h4>

<h4>Manifest:</h4>

<p>There are two types of manifest files: <strong>Project manifest</strong><strong>s</strong> and <strong>package manifest</strong><strong>s</strong>.</p>

<h4>Mutable*:</h4>

<p>You can change the contents of a mutable package. This is the opposite of <strong>immutable</strong>. Only <strong>Local package</strong><strong>s</strong> and <strong>Embedded package</strong><strong>s</strong> are mutable.</p>

<h4>Package manifest<em>:
Each package has a </em>manifest*, which provides information about the package to the Package Manager. The manifest contains information such as the name of the package, its version, a description for users, dependencies on other packages (if any), and other details. <a href="upm-manifestPkg.html">More info</a>
</h4>

<h4>Preview package<em>:
A </em>preview* package is in development and not yet ready for production. A package in preview might be at any stage of development, from the initial stages to near completion.</h4>

<h4>Project manifest<em>:
Each Unity Project has a </em>Project manifest*, which acts as an entry point for the Package Manager. This file must be available in the <code>&lt;project&gt;/Packages</code> directory. The Package Manager uses it to configure many things, including a list of dependencies for that Project, as well as any package repository to query for packages. <a href="upm-manifestPrj.html">More info</a>
</h4>

<h4>Verified package<em>:
When a package passes release cycle testing for a specific version of Unity, it receives the </em>Verified For* designation. This means that these packages are guaranteed to work with the designated version of Unity.</h4>
